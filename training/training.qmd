## Why CoMo?

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-lg-6 .g-col-12 .g-col-md-12}

::: {.text_justified}
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of pandemic preparedness and demonstrated that academia can deliver highly transformative interventions. The International Modelling Consortium (CoMo) was created in March 2020 by researchers at the University of Oxford, together with academic colleagues at Cornell University, and partners with infectious disease modellers and other public health experts from more than 40 countries across Africa, Asia and South and North America. Using a participatory approach, CoMo provides decision-making support to policymakers, using evidence from epidemiological and economic models adapted to each country’s context. With COVID-19 now endemic, CoMo continues to work with modellers and public health researchers on the challenges of a range of infectious diseases. To prepare for future pandemic challenges, CoMo members have highlighted the need for accessible training in health policy-facing modelling.

We have developed a programme of training on policy-facing public health modelling for a global audience. The overarching purpose is to widen global access and build modelling capacity in in-country settings. The benefits of this include improving pandemic preparedness, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. During the COVID-19 pandemic, modelling expertise was concentrated in high-income countries and CoMo was the only international community that supported LMIC leadership in the field. Also, of key importance is that this programme provides equitable access which aligns with a larger inter-divisional initiative, Global Equitable Oxford (with support from the Vice Chancellor’s Office), which aims to improve inclusivity and access to Oxford University expertise and connect with world-class researchers across the globe.

## Who is the programme designed for?

::: {.text_justified}

Our course modules for 2024 are aimed at entry level modellers, those who are exploring a career in modelling, or those in related professions who wish to know more about the discipline.

The courses are designed for those working in a range of sectors. For example, the public sector - medical professionals, data scientists, epidemiologists, health economists, medical statisticians; NGO staff; academic researchers; and those working in the private sector, the pharmaceutical and consulting industry.

Future modules will offer intermediate and advanced skills for mid-career modellers or related professionals who wish to build on foundational training and/or extend their technical repertoire.
We can also provide bespoke versions of this course for organisations. Please contact us <email address> if you would like to discuss this opportunity further.

## Courses

### Introduction to R for modellers {#course-r}

**Module lead: Dr Bo Gao** [Bio](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/team/bo-gao)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

::: {.text_justified}
This module gives introduction to the basic elements of the R programming language with emphasis on its application in the context of infectious disease modelling. The materials covered in this module underpins the technical aspect of the training programme. R is a popular programming language in the research community especially that of disease modelling. It is open source and freely available cross platforms. On top of the rich statistical computing package library it already has, R also enjoys the support of vibrant open-source community of researchers and developers who are constantly contributing to enrich the ecosystem around R. Packages such as ggplot and shiny give R users a unique advantage when it comes to communicating research outputs with a wider audience by making it incredibly easy to make graphical representations of data and publishing them online. During this module, we will take the students through key aspects of the R programming language starting from basic notations of the language to the introduction of popular data manipulation and visualisation packages.  The module concludes with advanced topics such as code profiling and optimisation. We will give examples of mathematical models during the module to give the students a hands-on experience in model building.

### Infectious Disease Modelling in Context: Introduction

**Module lead: Professor Ricardo Aguas** [Bio](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/team/ricardo-aguas)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

::: {.text_justified}
This module provides a practical introduction to the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases. Mathematical modelling is being used with increasing frequency and scope to address questions about infectious diseases both in terms of basic science and in terms of national and international policymaking. Mathematical modellers arrive at the discipline from many backgrounds ranging from epidemiology to economics. Mathematical modelling is an interdisciplinary activity which brings together elements from mathematics, computer science, economics, demographics, virology, and immunology.

In this module, the students will be supported to develop a set of basic mathematical modelling skills though a mix of practical sessions interspersed with short theory sessions. They will be given a thorough introduction to the core concepts and techniques that will permeate sessions throughout the week and some elective modules. This foundation will be solidified through key working examples and put into practice in R.  Throughout the week we will guide the students through the process of building a model suited to address a research/policy question, developing and implementing the model in mathematical and code forms, and interpret the short- and long-term dynamics produced. Starting from simple compartmental models, students will be exposed to a repository of different model typologies that could be used as a template for any future modelling exercise.

### Infectious Disease Modelling in Context: Intermediate

**Module Lead: Professor Lisa White** [Bio](https://www.medawar.ox.ac.uk/team/lisa-white)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
::: {.text_justified}
This module will provide students with the opportunity to create and develop their own models while being introduced to concepts and approaches specific to policy-facing modelling. In the academic sector, models are developed to address a scientific question and are communicated to an academic audience. However, to bridge the gap between academic work and health policy further knowledge, communication skills and styles of working are required. In this module students will engage in a series of group projects which will guide them through the process of inception, development, and application of their own models. In parallel, the students will receive lectures and engage in discussions to uncover the challenges of working in partnership with policymakers. Students will explore the broader context in which modelling sits within the public health decision-making ecosystem and gain insights into how to bring their research to impact.
